# hello-world

Sometimes, you're just a 36 year old lady. 
Out there in the world, and you say to yourself, 
"Hey lady, lets learn some new skills." 
You think, "Self?" 
Yes. This is self.
"Am I too old for learning new things?" 
Fuck nah. You're a smart lady. You got this. 
"Fuck yeah, self. I'm on it." 
Then you find yourself on github. 
"Self, wtf is this?" 
I don't know me, do what you do and figure this shit out. 
"Right, tutorials. I'm on it self." 

So here I am. Learning new things. 
Talking to myself in a repository. 
I dont even know what a repository is. 
I think that's why I'm here. 

It says write about myself.
I love dogs. 
Especially my dogs. 
I want more dogs to be my dogs. 

Done saying weird things now. 
Will forget I made this, read later, question sanity.
